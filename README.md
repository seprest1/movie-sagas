# Movie Sagas

Duration: 18 hr sprint/weekend.

I was tasked with creating  an app that would showcase movie posters and information after spending the week learning Sagas and SQL joins.

## Installation

- Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`.
- Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.

#### Install Dependencies

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`


## Features
Detailed instructions for the assignment can be found in the repo under `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

- Users can be routed to details page upon clicking poster image.
- Users can add their own movie information and it will load on the DOM.

#### Challenges

This was my first week using Saga to utilize data in multiple react components. It was also my first time implementing more complex SQL in order to gather and post data in multiple tables. I also implemented logic using the React Select module, which proved challenging at first. Lastly, as always, adding CSS and MUI can be difficult, for this project, I chose to learn how to access non-web-based fonts, converting them to Woff files, as well as creating a neon text effect for the header marquee.
